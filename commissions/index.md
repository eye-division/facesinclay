Commissions can be done from a combination of photos and sittings. I don’t do children. I usually need a minimum of 5 sittings of a couple of hours each. I would prefer to work on a sculpture over at least a twelve weeks. My studio is in Leics but I have access to working space in Oxfordshire and I may be able to find space to work in London if necessary.
  

A head of fired clay would probably start at about £300.
   

The end result can be a fired clay sculpture, or fired and glazed clay sculpture or a resin cast of the clay sculpture (which will be weather proof) or a bronze of the clay sculpture.
