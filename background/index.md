I have painted and drawn all my life and although I did an academic degree in English and History of Art we did a day a week in the studio and a degree show. While I worked as an accountant and solicitor I continued to do art at evening classes and courses at the Slade Summer School, Field Study Centres and West Dean. In 1997 I had the opportunity to do 10 lessons in sculpting portraits and enjoyed it but that was it. However in 2010 I went to Art in Action nr Wheatley, Oxon and did a two hour practical lesson in portrait sculpture and the teacher was so good I joined her class at The Institute in East Finchley for the next three years. 

Since then I have done an open studio event and some commissions.
